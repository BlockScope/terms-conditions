Terms and Conditions
====================

Here you’ll find terms and conditions, copied the `original
text <https://davelane.nz/terms-and-conditions>`__ and converted this
online to markdown using `puppy paste <https://puppypaste.com/>`__ that
I then converted by hand to LaTeX.

Viewing, Editing and Typesetting
--------------------------------

I recommend VsCode and its LaTeX Workshop plugin or LaTeX tools such as
TeXworks to view, edit and typeset the document to PDF.

Reusing these Terms for your FOSS business
------------------------------------------

    I just want to make explicit the fact that these terms and
    conditions are available for anyone to reuse under the `CC-By
    4.0 <http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/>`__ license -
    you just need to say where you got them from - you can provide a
    link to this web page. They were originally composed for my previous
    company, Egressive, by one of our developers, Chris Noël, who also
    had most of a law degree and constructed them painstakingly based on
    first principles and by consulting law texts here in NZ. For what
    it’s worth, the various corporate lawyers I’ve dealt with using
    these terms have unanimously praised them as well written and
    comprehensive…

Why Subfiles?
-------------

Why did I break the document down into subfiles, each with a ``-nz.tex``
filename suffix? This helps me review other agreements after breaking
those documents into subfiles using the same section names as used here
but with an alternative suffix, such as ``-us.tex``.

.. code:: diff
