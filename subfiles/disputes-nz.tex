\section{Disputes Resolution}

\begin{enumerate}
\item If any dispute arises between the Purchaser and the Supplier in relation
to the Agreement, then the parties must first try to settle the dispute by
way of good faith negotiations. Any dispute, which cannot be settled by good
faith negotiations within fourteen days, must be submitted to mediation. The
parties must mediate the dispute in accordance with the Mediation Rules of
the New Zealand Chapter of Lawyers Engaged in Alternative Dispute Resolution
(LEADR), or its successor, and the Executive Chair of LEADR (or his nominee)
shall select the mediator and determine the mediator's remuneration.
