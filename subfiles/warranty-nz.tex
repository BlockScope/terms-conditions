\section{Warranty}

\begin{enumerate}
\item All conditions, guarantees and warranties expressed or implied by statute,
common law, equity, trade customer usage or otherwise, are expressly excluded
to the maximum extent permitted by law.
\item The Supplier's liability for breach of condition, guarantee or warranty
that cannot be excluded under clause 5.1 is limited, at the Supplier's
option, to make good by repair or by replacement within a reasonable time.
This applies to any defects which appear in the Project that arise from
non-compliance with specifications, faulty development, design, material,
workmanship, or error provided that:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Such defects appear within three months of delivery; and
    \item The Purchaser has notified the Supplier in writing within seven days
    of the alleged defect first coming to the Purchaser's notice; and
    \item That the Deliverable has been properly handled and used and has been
    installed, operated and maintained in accordance with instructions
    provided under the Agreement, if any; and
    \item Any such defects result in the performance of the Project deviating
    from the specifications; and
    \item Any such defects are not the result of alterations or modifications
    made to the Project without prior authorisation by the Supplier; and
    \item Any such defects are not the result of using the Project in
    combination with equipment, software or services not authorised in
    writing by the Supplier; and
    \item Any such defects are not the result of using the Project in an
    operating system environment not recommended by The Supplier or in a
    fashion other than in accordance with the Supplier's reasonable
    directions; and
    \item Any such defects are not the result of a failure on the part of the
    Purchaser to meet its obligations under the Agreement.
    \end{enumerate}
\item The warranty given under clause 5.2 does not apply to any third party
software incorporated into the Project nor does the Supplier accept any
responsibility for any defect in such software or in the Project arising from
a defect in said third party software.
\item The Supplier does not warrant that:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item the Project is free of defects; or
    \item Use of the Project will be uninterrupted; or
    \item The Project will meet any of the Purchaser's requirements other than
    those explicitly stated in the Agreement.
    \end{enumerate}
\item The Purchaser agrees that any goods and services supplied under the
Agreement are for business purposes and as such the Consumer Guarantees Act
1993 does not apply.
\end{enumerate}
